## About

TL;DR: Accepts the files Netflix stores their subtitles in and displays the subtitles in a RichTextBox.

Aimed at students taking notes while watching Netflix documentaries, this app allows users to open the files containing their video's subtitles and highlight the subtitles they feel are important as they watch their videos. The highlighted subtitles are then displayed over all the subtitles in a RichTextBox, where the information can be copied and then pasted into the user's word processor of choice.
