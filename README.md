## About

This app accepts Netflix's subtitle files and displays the subtitles in a RichTextBox.

Aimed at students taking notes on Netflix documentaries, a user can select the subtitles they feel are important as their video plays, and then send them (alongside all the subtitles) to a RichTextBox, where the text can be copied and pasted into their word processor of choice.

## How to Use

You'll need a file to open from Netflix. For video instructions, click [here](https://youtu.be/ZxjZbvVSSG4) or on the Help link in the app.

-	Select the Network tab.
